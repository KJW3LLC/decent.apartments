### 3. Content Calendar Strategy

**Option A: Progressive Learning (Recommended)**
Follow learning paths sequentially to help readers build knowledge:
- Week 1-2: AI Fundamentals Path
- Week 3-4: Practical AI Usage Path
- Week 5-6: AI Applications Path
- Week 7: Ethics & Responsibility topics
- Week 8+: Rotate through Technical Deep Dive and remaining topics

**Option B: Difficulty Rotation**
Alternate difficulty levels to serve all audiences:
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Beginner or Intermediate
- Tuesday/Thursday: Intermediate or Advanced
- This keeps content accessible while still serving advanced users

**Option C: Random with Balance (Current Implementation)**
Let the system randomly select, ensuring variety
- Pros: Unpredictable, covers diverse topics quickly
- Cons: May not build on previous knowledge

**Recommendation**: Switch to Option A (Progressive Learning) for better SEO and user retention

### 4. Cross-Linking Strategy

The system already adds "Related Guides" based on shared tags. To maximize this:

**Tag Optimization**:
- Ensure each topic has 3-4 relevant tags
- Use consistent tag naming
- Create tag hierarchies (e.g., "ai-fundamentals" as parent, "neural-networks" as child)

**Current Strong Tag Groups**:
- `language-models`: 8 topics
- `neural-networks`: 5 topics
- `applications`: 7 topics
- `machine-learning`: 10 topics
- `training`: 8 topics

## Adding New Topics

### Quick Add Process

1. **Edit `topics.json`** and add new topic:
```json
{
  "title": "Your Topic Title",
  "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
}
```

2. **Commit and push** - the system will randomly select from the pool

### Topic Selection Criteria

When adding new topics, ensure they:
1. **Fill a gap**: Does it answer a common question not yet covered?
2. **Have search volume**: Would people search for this?
3. **Are evergreen**: Will this be relevant in 1-2 years?
4. **Are explainable**: Can it be explained in 800-1500 words?
5. **Have resources**: Are there 2-3 good external resources to link to?

### Tag Guidelines

**Create new tags when**:
- Starting a new topic area (e.g., "edge-ai", "quantum-ml")
- Grouping related concepts (e.g., "optimization" for various optimization topics)

**Reuse existing tags when possible** to maximize cross-linking:
- `basics`, `introduction`, `ai-fundamentals`
- `applications`, `practical`
- `language-models`, `neural-networks`, `machine-learning`, `deep-learning`
- `training`, `optimization`
- `ethics`, `safety`, `privacy`

## Content Quality Guidelines

### For Future Topic Ideas
- Focus on "Why" not just "What"
- Include real-world examples
- Explain complexity simply (use analogies)
- Link back to foundational concepts
- Always include "Try It Yourself" section

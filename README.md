# Decent Apartments

An AI education website that automatically generates and publishes step-by-step guides on AI topics. Built with Jekyll and powered by NVIDIA's free AI models for both text (Llama 3.1 70B) and images (FLUX.1-schnell), new educational content with custom AI-generated illustrations is automatically created and deployed on every commit.

## Features

- **Automatic Content Generation**: AI-powered guide generation using NVIDIA's free Llama 3.1 70B model
- **AI-Generated Images**: Custom illustrations created by NVIDIA's free FLUX.1-schnell (fast, commercial-use) for each guide
- **Daily Publishing**: New guides automatically generated and published every day
- **Link Validation**: Automatic checking of external links to ensure quality resources
- **Instructables-Style Design**: Clear, step-by-step guides with approachable language
- **Difficulty Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced topics
- **Cross-Linking**: Related guides automatically linked based on shared topics
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile
- **Search & Filter**: Find guides by difficulty level or search keywords
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automatically deployed and hosted for free

## Live Site

Visit the site at: [https://decent.apartments](https://decent.apartments) (configure your domain)

## How It Works

1. Every day at 10:17 AM UTC, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs
2. The workflow runs a Node.js script that:
   - Selects an unused topic from the curated list (50+ topics available)
   - Calls NVIDIA's free API to generate an educational guide
   - Validates all external links to ensure quality resources
   - Generates a custom illustration using NVIDIA FLUX.1-schnell
   - Finds related guides based on shared tags
   - Creates a markdown file with proper front matter and image attribution
   - Commits the new guide back to the repository
3. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys the updated site

You can also trigger generation manually or on every push to main branch.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- A GitHub account
- A free NVIDIA API key ([get one here](https://build.nvidia.com/)) - used for both text and image generation

### Getting Your Free NVIDIA API Key

1. Visit [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/)
2. Click "Get API Key" or sign in with your NVIDIA account (free to create)
3. Navigate to any model page (e.g., "meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct")
4. Click "Get API Key" button
5. Copy your API key - you'll use this for both local development and GitHub

**Note**: NVIDIA's API is completely free with generous rate limits - no credit card required! One API key gives you access to both text generation (Llama 3.1 70B) and image generation (FLUX.1-schnell).

### Local Development

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Jekyll** (for local preview)
   ```bash
   gem install bundler jekyll
   ```

4. **Set up your API key**
   ```bash
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY='your-nvidia-api-key-here'
   ```

5. **Generate a guide locally** (optional)
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

6. **Run Jekyll locally**
   ```bash
   jekyll serve
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:4000` to preview the site

   - Value: Your free NVIDIA API key from build.nvidia.com
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Push your code**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/decent.apartments.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` / `root`
   - Click Save

5. **Wait for deployment**
   - The first workflow run will generate a new guide
   - GitHub Pages will build and deploy your site
   - Visit `https://yourusername.github.io/decent.apartments`

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Add a CNAME file**
   ```bash
   echo "decent.apartments" > CNAME
   git add CNAME
   git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   git push
   ```

2. **Configure DNS**
   - Add a CNAME record pointing to `yourusername.github.io`
   - Or add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs
   - See [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

3. **Update `_config.yml`**
   ```yaml
   url: "https://decent.apartments"
   ```

## Configuration

### Adding Topics

**Interactive Method (Recommended)**:
```bash
npm run add-topic
```

This will interactively prompt you for:
- Topic title
- Difficulty level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Tags (comma-separated)

**Manual Method**:
Edit `topics.json` directly:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Topic Title",
  "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
}
```

**View Popular Tags**:
```bash
npm run show-tags
```

See `CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` for comprehensive content planning guidance.

### Customizing the Design

- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `assets/css/main.css`
- **Layout**: Modify templates in `_layouts/`
- **Components**: Edit includes in `_includes/`

### Adjusting Content Generation

Edit `scripts/generate-guide.js` to:
- Change the AI model (currently using NVIDIA's Llama 3.1 70B - see other free models at build.nvidia.com)
- Modify the prompt for different content styles
- Adjust the guide structure or format

### AI-Generated Images with NVIDIA FLUX.1-schnell

The site uses **NVIDIA's FLUX.1-schnell** via their free API to automatically generate custom, modern tech illustrations for each guide. This is part of the same free NVIDIA API you're already using for text generation!

**Why FLUX.1-schnell?**
- ⚡ **Fast**: Generates images in 1-4 steps (vs 50 for dev)
- ✅ **Commercial use allowed**: Perfect for any project
- 🎨 **High quality**: Still produces excellent results
- 💰 **Free**: Same NVIDIA API, no extra cost

**Image Features**:
- Modern, professional tech illustrations
- Clean design with vibrant gradients (blues, purples, teals)
- Abstract geometric shapes and subtle tech motifs
- 1024x1024 resolution, perfect for blog headers
- Generated in ~10-20 seconds

**Adding Images to Existing Guides**:
Use the retroactive image generation script to add AI-generated images to all existing guides:
```bash
npm run add-images
```

This script will:
1. Scan all guides in `_guides/`
2. Generate custom illustrations for guides without images using NVIDIA FLUX.1-schnell
3. Update front matter with image paths and attribution
4. Save images to `assets/images/guides/`
5. Automatically includes a 2-second delay between generations to respect rate limits

**Important Notes**:
- Uses the same `NVIDIA_API_KEY` as text generation - no additional setup needed!
- Each image generation takes ~10-20 seconds
- Free tier has generous rate limits
- High-quality results comparable to premium services

**Manual Image Addition**:
To manually add images to a guide, add these fields to the front matter:
```yaml
image: "/assets/images/guides/your-image.jpg"
image_credit: "Generated by NVIDIA FLUX.1-schnell"
image_credit_url: "https://build.nvidia.com/black-forest-labs/flux_1-schnell"
```

**Customizing Image Style**:
Edit the `generateImagePrompt` function in `scripts/generate-guide.js` to change:
- Color palette and visual style
- Composition and layout elements
- Art style (illustration, diagram, photorealistic, etc.)
- Mood and aesthetic

**Using Different NVIDIA Models**:
NVIDIA offers several image generation models on build.nvidia.com:
- `flux.1-schnell` (current, fast, commercial use allowed)
- `flux.1-dev` (best quality, slower, non-commercial use only)
- `stable-diffusion-3-medium` (Stability AI's latest)
- `stable-diffusion-xl` (classic SDXL)

Change the endpoint in both scripts to switch models.

## Guide Format

Each guide includes:
- **Introduction**: What you'll learn
- **Prerequisites**: Required background (if any)
- **Step-by-step sections**: Clear explanations with headers
- **Real-world examples**: Practical applications
- **Try It Yourself**: Hands-on activities
- **Key Takeaways**: Summary bullet points
- **Further Reading**: Resources for deeper learning

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "NVIDIA_API_KEY not set"

Make sure you've added `NVIDIA_API_KEY` as a GitHub secret (see GitHub Setup step 2).

### Image generation fails

If you get errors during image generation:
- Check that your `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is valid and active
- Ensure you have quota remaining on your free tier
- Try again - occasional API errors can occur
- Check the error message for specific details (content filtered, rate limit, etc.)

### Site not updating after push

1. Check the Actions tab for workflow status
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in settings
3. Wait a few minutes for Pages deployment to complete

### Generated guide has formatting issues

Check the NVIDIA API response in the workflow logs. You may need to adjust the prompt in `generate-guide.js`.

### Running out of topics

The script will automatically reset and reuse topics when all have been generated. Edit `generated-topics.json` to manually reset.
